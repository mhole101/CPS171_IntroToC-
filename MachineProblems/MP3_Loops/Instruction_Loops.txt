Machine Problem 3 – Loops

Say a real estate office handles 50 apartment units. When the rent is $600 per month, all the units are occupied. However, for each $40 increase in rent, one unit becomes vacant. Moreover, each occupied unit requires an average of $27 per month for maintenance. How many units should be rented to maximize the profit?
Write a program that prompts the user to enter:
1.	The total number of units.
2.	The rent to occupy all the units.
3.	The increase in rent that results in a vacant unit.
4.	Amount to maintain a rented unit.
Here is a sample output:
This program is written by your name.
Please enter total number of units: 50
Please enter the rent: 600
Please enter the increase: 40
Please enter the maintenance: 27
Number of units to give me the maximum profit is : XX
Your program should replace the XX with the answer.
You can display the table to prove it like this:
units        rent       profit
50             600       28650
49             640       30037
48             680       xxxxxx
...etc
